### What I learned


To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

To create the overlay I made a div that would contain the overlay color and an <img> that contains the eyeball image

```html
<div class="image-container">
            <img class="nft-image" src="images/image-equilibrium.jpg" alt="equilibrium NFT"></img>
            <!--overlay markkup when mouse is over the nft image-->
            <div class="nft__overlay">
                <!--eye icon that is displayed on overlay-->
                <img src="images/icon-view.svg" alt="white eyeball">
            </div>
        </div>
```

The css involved having a class for the overlay properties. Its position would be absolute to have it stack on top of the nft image.
The background property has an rgba that would have the cyan color and an opacity of 0.5 to make it transparent. Its opacity would be defaulted as 0 to not show up when not hovered over.
When hovering over the nft image the overlay would change to 1 showing the styling applied. A transition for the opacity effect was added for a cooler effect made.

```css
.image-container {
  position: relative;
  top: 20px;
}

.nft__overlay {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 17px;
  width: 88%;
  height: 100%;
  border-radius: 7px;
  background: rgba(0, 255, 247, 0.5);
  opacity: 0;
  transition: opacity 0.25s;
  cursor: pointer;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}

.nft__overlay:hover {
  opacity: 1;
}
